\section{Deformation and structure of solids}
\subsection{Strength}
How much force can a material withstand before it fails?
That's a materials strength.
A material can fail in several ways but the two most common are fracturing and permanent deformation.

\subsection{Stress}
Engineers typically talk about stress instead of forces because stress is just a force proportional to its area.
Stress is represented by the greek letter sigma ($\sigma$) and is given by the force (F) divided by the cross-sectional area (A).

\marginnote{Cross-sectional area is the area that is perpendicular to the applied force}

\begin{equation*}
  \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \\
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
  \begin{flalign*}
    \text{Given: } m=25\unit{kg}, d=10\unit{mm} \\
    A = \pi r^2 \\
    A = \pi \times \frac{(0.01)^2}{2} \\
    F = 25 \times 9.81 \\
    \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \\
    \sigma = 3,120,000 \unit{Pa} \\
    \sigma = 3.12 \unit{MPa} \\
  \end{flalign*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Strain}
Strain is how long something gets compared to its original size.
Stress and strain are related very closely and the stress against strain graph is a very important thing to materials engineering.
Strain is given by the change in length over the original length.

\begin{equation*}
  \epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_o} 
\end{equation*}  

Strain is unitless but is commonly expressed as a percentage (\%).

\begin{example}
  \begin{align*}
    \epsilon &= \frac{\Delta L}{L_o} \\
             &= \frac{100.32\unit{mm}-100\unit{mm}}{100\unit{mm}} \\ 
            &= \frac{0.32\unit{mm}}{100\unit{mm}} \\ 
            &= 0.0032 \\
            &= 0.32\% \\ 
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Stress-Strain Curve}

\en{Necking is a localised reduction in thickness, which reduces diameter, which reduces area, increasing stress. This causes it to fail.}[-4cm]

\subsection{Poisson's Ratio}
Poisson's ratio is the relationship between deformation for a given material. 
It is a measure of the Poisson effect, that describes the expansion or contraction of a material in directions perpendicular to the direction of loading. 
It has no units and is represented by the greek character `nu' ($\nu$).
For most materials $\nu \approx 0.3$.

\begin{equation*}
\nu = \frac{-\epsilon_x}{\epsilon_z}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Young's Modulus}
The Young's Modulus of a material is a measure of the `stiffness'. 
It is the gradient of the elastic part of the stress-strain curve for a given material.
It has units of Pascals (Pa) and is represented by the capital letter E. 

\begin{equation*}
  E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \epsilon} 
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Steel}
Steel has what is called a `discontinuous yield'.  
This means at the yield strength there is a bit of `noise' and it moves a little randomly before becoming nonlinear. 

\subsection{0.2\% Proof Stress}
The 0.2\% Proof Stress of a material is a geometrical construct that is used when the yield stress of a material cannot be properly determined. 
It is a very slight overestimate (generally) that can be calculated by drawing a line parallel to the actual curve at a strain of $0.002$ and finding the intersection with the original curve.
This stress value is the approximation. 

\subsection{Safety Factor}
The safety factor is a scalar value that demonstrates how much more stress a material can hold relative to the requirement. 
I.e. if, for example, $F \approx 1000\unit{N}$ the engineers might pretend $F = 2000N$. 
This would gie a safety factor of 2.

When the conditions of the material are more uncertain, you would want a higher safety factor.

\subsection{Engineering Stress vs Real Stress}
In engineering, we draw a stress-strain graph as going `down' after the ultimate tensile strength.
In reality, because of the effect of necking, it goes up after this.
As engineers, we use the model because it is easier to handle theoretically.

\subsection{Ductility}
Ductility is a measure of how much something can deform elastically (with 100\% recovery / without permanent deformation).
The stress-strain graph of a ductile material will have a longer elastic section while a more brittle material (less ductile) will have a shorter one.
It is generally described by one of two equations: 

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Percentage Elongation}
\end{center}
\begin{equation*}
  = \frac{\Delta L}{L_o} \times 100\% 
\end{equation*}

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Percentage Reduction in Area}
\end{center}
\begin{equation*}
  = \frac{\Delta A}{A_o} \times 100\% 
\end{equation*}

\section{Microstructure and mechanical properties}
\subsection{Crystal Structure}
\begin{definition*}
  If a material is crystalline, the atoms of a material have \textbf{LONG RANGE ORDER}. 
  This means the material is made up of a crystal lattice made of repeating units called `unit cells'. 
\end{definition*}

There are 14 possible crystal arrangements but this course will only look at three. 
We describe arrangements by looking at the unit cell. 
The unit cell is a tessellating shape that has all the information to describe the entire lattice.

The unit cell has 4 important properties: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of atoms 
  \item Co-ordination Number (The number of neighbours for the unit cell)
  \item Unit Cell Dimension (The length of each side of the cell written `a')
  \item Atomic Packing Factor (Amount of space taken up by the atoms)
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation*}
  a = \text{ Atomic Packing Factor } = \frac{\text{volume of atoms}}{\text{volume of unit cell}}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Body Centered Cubic} 
Body Centered Cubic (BCC) has one atom at each corner of a cube and one right in the middle.
\begin{marginfigure}
  \vspace{ -1cm }
  \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{bcc}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of Atoms = $2 = 1 + 8 \times \frac{1}{8}$
  \item Co-ordination Number = 8 
  \item Unit cell dimension = $\frac{4R}{\sqrt{3}}$
  \item APF = 0.68 = 0.68\%
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Face Centered Cubic}
Face Centered Cubic (FCC) has one atom at each corner of a cube and one in the middle of each face of the cube.
\begin{marginfigure}
  \vspace{ -1cm }
  \includegraphics[scale=0.11]{fcc}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of Atoms = $4$
  \item Co-ordination Number = 12 
  \item unit cell dimension = $\frac{4R}{\sqrt{2}}$
  \item APF = 0.74 = 0.74\%
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hexagonal Close Packed}
Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) is a prism shape with hexagonal arrangements of atoms layered up.
\begin{marginfigure}
  \vspace{ -1cm }
  \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{hcp}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of Atoms = $6$
  \item Co-ordination Number = 12 
  \item APF = 0.74 = 0.74\%
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Density}
Density is the degree of compactness of a substance. 
The amount of mass you get for a given volume.
The density of a material is its mass divided by its volume.
\begin{equation*}
  \rho = \frac{n.A}{V_c.N_a}
\end{equation*}
Where $n$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $A$ is the atomic mass of the material, $V_c$ is the volume of the unit cell ($a^3$) and $N_a$ is Avrogado's Number.

\begin{example}
  Iron
  \begin{gather*}
    a = 0.286\unit{nm }, n = 2 \\
    \rho = \frac{ 2 \times 55.85 }{(2.86\times10^{-8})^3 \times 6.023 \times 10^{23}} \\
    \rho = 7.92\unit{g.cm}^{-3}
  \end{gather*}
  The real density of iron is 7.87$\unit{g.cm}^{-3}$ so this is a good estimate.
\end{example}

\subsection{Polymorphism}
Materials that can exist in more than one crystal form (can have lattices made up of different unit cells) are called polymorphic. 
For example, Iron at room temperature has a BCC structure but at $912^\circ$C it has an FCC structure.

\subsection{Planes, Directions and Positions}
Navigation around our crystal structures is based on a typical x,y,z orthogonal axis. 
We can denote the postition of an atom using a typical three dimensional vector. 
By convention, positions are denoted with round brackets.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \vspace{-1.5cm}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{positions}
\end{marginfigure}


\subsubsection{Directions}
Directions in the lattice are defined with square brackets $[u,v,w]$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw a vector from the origin for the direction 
  \item Project the length of the vector onto the unit cell axes 
  \item Put this in terms of the coefficients 
  \item Convert to integers (multiply by a constant)
  \item Put in square brackets 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
  Projecting the length of the vector onto axes:
  $1a$ $0b$ $\half c$

  Put this in terms of co-efficients:
  $1$ $0$ $\half$

  Convert to integers (multiply by two):
  2 0 1

  Put in square brackets:
  $[201]$
\end{example}

Note: Negative directions will have a bar over them (read `bar').  

\begin{equation*}
[1\bar{1}0]
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Planes}
Planes in the lattice are defined by \textbf{Miller Indices} $(h,k,l)$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Work out the intercepts of the plane on the unit cell 
  \item Take reciprocals of the intercepts 
  \item Convert to integers (multiply by a constant)
  \item Put in round brackets 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
  Intercepts: $1$ $-1$ $\infty$

  Reciprocals: $1$ $-1$ $0$

  Integers: $1$ $-1$ $0$

  Round Brackets: $(1\bar{1}0)$
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Families}

You can denote the `family' of a plane (all of the planes made up with these values). 
Families of planes are denoted with curly brackets e.g. Cube Faces $\{100\}$.
Families of directions are denoted with angle brackets e.g. $<100>$.
